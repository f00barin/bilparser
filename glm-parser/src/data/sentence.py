Some basic comcepts are depicted here:

Global vector: A dict-like object that stores mapping like below:
    {
        'feature_string1': 1.0,
        'feature_string2': 1.0,
        'feature_string3': 1.0,
        ...
    }
    It holds all features derived from all edges in a given tree
    structure, therefore, the global vector contains information
    about every edge in the tree.

Local vector: Similar to the global vector, except that it only
stores features derived from a single edge. In order to derive
a global vector from local vectors, we just aggregate them and
take the union of all local features.

Feature caching: Feature is generally computed given three indexes:
the head index, dependency index, and extra index (sibling, grand child,
or None). Computing features for frequently-queried index combinations
are tiresome, and slows down overall performance, therefore, we decide
to cache some frequently used local vector.

argmax *OR* gold edge set ->
edge ->
(h[ead], d[dpendency], o[ther]) ->
local vector -(aggregate)->
global vector

class Sentence():
    """
    A data structure that represents the result of a dependency parser.

    Each class instance stores four types of information. These information
    are: node set, POS set, edge set and edge type. Users could construct
    a dependency tree through these information.

    This class also provides interfaces to manipulate the information, including
    retriving nodes, edges, types, modifying nodes, edges, types, and other
    relevant tasks.
